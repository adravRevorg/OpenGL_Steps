# OpenGL_Steps
A step by step flow for learning OpenGL  
Based on the guide by: https://learnopengl.com/

Summary notes are provided at the end of each program.

1. A solid colored window
2. Triangles  
    - Solid colored triangle
    - Solid rectangle using the above code
    - Solid color, changing with time (Use of uniforms)
    - Interpolated color fill in triangle
 3. Shader Class (to create shaders)
 4. Use of multiple VAO, VBO  
    - Use multiple VAO to draw two triangles
    - Use multiple VAO, and multiple shaders to draw two triangles (one with uniform, one with interpolation)
